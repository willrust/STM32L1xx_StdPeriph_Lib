 @par Directory contents
 
 - project .rprj/.rapp: A pre-configured project file with the provided library 
                        structure that produces an executable image with RIDE7.

 - stm32l152d_extram.ld: This file is the RAISONANCE linker script used to 
                         place program code (readonly) in internal FLASH 
                         and data (readwrite, Stack and Heap)in external SRAM.
                         You can customize this file to your need.
 @par How to use it ?
 
 - Open the Project.rprj project.
 - In the configuration toolbar(Project->properties) select the project config:
     - STM32L152-EVAL: to configure the project for STM32L1xx Ultra Low Power 
                       Medium-Density Devices
     @note The needed define symbols for this config are already declared in the
           preprocessor section: USE_STDPERIPH_DRIVER, STM32L1XX_MD, USE_STM32L152_EVAL
     - STM32L152D-EVAL: to configure the project for STM32L1xx Ultra Low Power 
                       High-Density Devices
     @note The needed define symbols for this config are already declared in the
           preprocessor section: USE_STDPERIPH_DRIVER, STM32L1XX_HD, USE_STM32L152D_EVAL
 - Rebuild all files: Project->build project
 - Load project image: Debug->start(ctrl+D)
 - Run program: Debug->Run(ctrl+F9)  

@note
- Ultra Low Power Medium-density devices are STM32L151xx and STM32L152xx 
  microcontrollers where the Flash memory density ranges between 64 and 128 Kbytes.
- Ultra Low Power Medium-density Plus devices are STM32L151xx, STM32L152xx and 
  STM32L162xx microcontrollers where the Flash memory density is 256 Kbytes.
- Ultra Low Power High-density devices are STM32L151xx, STM32L152xx and STM32L162xx 
  microcontrollers where the Flash memory density is 384 Kbytes.
