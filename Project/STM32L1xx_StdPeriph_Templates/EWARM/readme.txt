                           structure that produces an executable image with IAR 
                           Embedded Workbench.
                
 - stm32l1xx_flash.icf : This file is the IAR Linker configuration file used to 
                         place program code (readonly) in internal FLASH and data
                         (readwrite, Stack and Heap)in internal SRAM. 
                         You can customize this file to your need.

 @par How to use it ?

 - Open the Project.eww workspace.
 - In the workspace toolbar select the project config:
     - STM32L152-EVAL: to configure the project for STM32L Ultra Low Power 
                       Medium-density devices.
     @note The needed define symbols for this config are already declared in the
           preprocessor section: USE_STDPERIPH_DRIVER, STM32L1XX_MD, USE_STM32L152_EVAL
     - STM32L152D-EVAL: to configure the project for STM32L Ultra Low Power 
                        High-density devices.
     @note The needed define symbols for this config are already declared in the
           preprocessor section: USE_STDPERIPH_DRIVER, STM32L1XX_HD, USE_STM32L152D_EVAL

 - Rebuild all files: Project->Rebuild all
 - Load project image: Project->Debug
 - Run program: Debug->Go(F5)

@note
- Ultra Low Power Medium-density devices are STM32L151xx and STM32L152xx 
  microcontrollers where the Flash memory density ranges between 64 and 128 Kbytes.
- Ultra Low Power Medium-density Plus devices are STM32L151xx, STM32L152xx and 
  STM32L162xx microcontrollers where the Flash memory density is 256 Kbytes.
- Ultra Low Power High-density devices are STM32L151xx, STM32L152xx and STM32L162xx 
  microcontrollers where the Flash memory density is 384 Kbytes.
