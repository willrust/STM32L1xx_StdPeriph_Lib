 @par Directory contents
 
 - Project.uvproj/.uvopt: A pre-configured project file with the provided library structure
                          that produces an executable image with MDK-ARM.

Enabling "Options for Target 'Output' Browser Information" is useful for quick 
source files navigation but may slow the compilation time.
 
 
 @par How to use it ?
 
 - Open the Project.Uv2 project
 - In the build toolbar select the project config:
     - STM32L152-EVAL: to configure the project for STM32L Ultra Low Power 
                       Medium-density devices.
     @note The needed define symbols for this config are already declared in the
           preprocessor section: USE_STDPERIPH_DRIVER, STM32L1XX_MD, USE_STM32L152_EVAL
     - STM32L152D-EVAL: to configure the project for STM32L Ultra Low Power 
                       High-density devices.
     @note The needed define symbols for this config are already declared in the
           preprocessor section: USE_STDPERIPH_DRIVER, STM32L1XX_HD, USE_STM32L152D_EVAL
 - Rebuild all files: Project->Rebuild all target files
 - Load project image: Debug->Start/Stop Debug Session
 - Run program: Debug->Run (F5)

@note
- Ultra Low Power Medium-density devices are STM32L151xx and STM32L152xx 
  microcontrollers where the Flash memory density ranges between 64 and 128 Kbytes.
- Ultra Low Power Medium-density Plus devices are STM32L151xx, STM32L152xx and 
  STM32L162xx microcontrollers where the Flash memory density is 256 Kbytes.
- Ultra Low Power High-density devices are STM32L151xx, STM32L152xx and STM32L162xx 
  microcontrollers where the Flash memory density is 384 Kbytes.
