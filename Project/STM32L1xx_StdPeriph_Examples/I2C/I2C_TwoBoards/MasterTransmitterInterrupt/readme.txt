@par Example Description 

This example provides a small application in which joystick buttons are used 
to trigger I2C communication using interrupt and though using I2C firmware library.

- Hardware Description

To use this example, you need to load it on two STM32 boards (let's call them 
Board A and Board B) then connect these two boards through I2C lines and GND.
In the firmware example uncomment the dedicated line in the main.h file  to use
the I2C peripheral as STM32 Master device or as STM32 Slave .

- Software Description

This example requires two boards(Master and Slave)

In master board, I2C peripheral is configured as Master Transmitter with Interrupt,
whereas in Slave board, I2C peripheral is configured as Slave Receiver with Interrupt.
According to the pushed joystick button in the master board a specific LED will 
be ON in the slave board.

At each joystick position press
 - The master sends the defined NumberOfByte from TxBuffer to the slave 
 - The Slave compares the NumberOfByte received data with the defined ones into TxBuffer

Received data correctness is signaled by LED lightening and though as follow:
   - Joystick RIGHT and data correctly received ==> LD2, LD3 ON and LD4 OFF 
   - Joystick LEFT and data correctly received  ==> LD4 ON, LD2 and LD3 are OFF
   - Joystick UP and data correctly received    ==> LD2 ON, LD3 and LD4 are OFF
   - Joystick DOWN and data correctly received  ==> LD3 ON, LD2 and LD4 are OFF
   - Joystick SEL and data correctly received   ==> LD2, LD3 and LD4 are ON
   
Communication error are handled in both Master and Slave sides, their occurrence
will be signaled respectively by puting LED3 and LED4 On.
 
The File "I2C/I2C_TwoBoards/MasterTransmitterInterrupt/main.h" allows different 
possibilities of configuration of this example:
  - Addressing mode : 7-bit or 10-bit
  - I2C speed: Fast mode or Standard mode
  - Buffer size also can be configured
  
In both boards, the data transfers is managed using I2Cx_EV_IRQHandler 
and I2Cx_ER_IRQHandler in stm32l1xx_it.c file.

The SysTick is configured to generate interrupt each 10ms. A dedicated counter 
inside the SysTick ISR is used to toggle the LD1 each 100ms indicating that the 
firmware is running.

A defined communication timeout is insuring that the application will not remain 
stuck if the I2C Master communication is corrupted.
You can adjust this timeout through the USER_TIMEOUT  define inside main.h file
depending on CPU frequency and application conditions (interrupts routines, 
number of data to transfer, speed, CPU frequency...).

These operations can be repeated infinitely.

@par Hardware and Software environment
  
  - This example runs on STM32L1xx Ultra Low Power High-, Medium-Density and Medium-Density Plus Devices.

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32L152D-EVAL (STM32L1xx 
    Ultra Low Power High-Density) and STM32L152-EVAL (STM32L1xx Ultra Low 
    Power Medium-Density) evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any 
    other supported device and development board.

  - STM32L152-EVAL Set-up

    - Connect I2C1 Master SCL pin (PB.06) to I2C1 Slave SCL (PB.06)
    - Connect I2C1 Master SDA pin (PB.07) to I2C1 Slave SDA (PB.07)

  - STM32L152D-EVAL Set-up

    - Connect I2C1 Master SCL pin (PB.08) to I2C1 Slave SCL (PB.08)
    - Connect I2C1 Master SDA pin (PB.09) to I2C1 Slave SDA (PB.09)

   @note  
    - Pull-up resistors should be connected to I2C SCL and SDA Pins in case of 
      other boards use.
      Pull-up  resistors are already implemented on the STM32L152-EVAL and STM32L152D-EVAL
      evaluation boards.  
        
@par How to use it ?

   Project\STM32L1xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example

@note
- Ultra Low Power Medium-density devices are STM32L151xx and STM32L152xx

- Ultra Low Power Medium-density Plus devices are STM32L151xx, STM32L152xx and 
  STM32L162xx microcontrollers where the Flash memory density is 256 Kbytes.
- Ultra Low Power High-density devices are STM32L151xx, STM32L152xx and STM32L162xx 
  microcontrollers where the Flash memory density is 384 Kbytes.
