@par Example Description 

This is a typical example of how to use the I2C software library to ensure the
steps of an I2C communication between slave Receiver/transmitter and master 
transmitter/receiver using interrupts.

- Hardware Description

To use this example, you need to load it on two STM32 boards (let's call them 
Board A and Board B) then connect these two boards through I2C lines and GND.
In the firmware example uncomment the dedicated line in the main.h file  to use
the I2C peripheral as STM32 Master device or as STM32 Slave .

- Software Description

This example requires two boards(Master and Slave)

  - Phase 1:
    In master board I2C peripheral is configured in Master Transmitter with Interrupt,
    where in Slave board I2C peripheral is configured in Slave Receiver with Interrupt.
    The master will send Data to Slave according to the defined buffer size.
   
  - Phase 2: 
    In master board I2C peripheral is configured in Master Receiver with Interrupt,
    where in Slave board I2C peripheral is configured in Slave Transmitter with 
    Interrupt. 
    Once the master has initiated the communication (Start condition), the slave
    will send back the data to the master according to the defined buffer size.
   
At the end of the data transfer, a data consistency check will be performed 
in master and slave sides. In case of mismatch between sent and received data,
all LED's are OFF. Otherwise LED2, LED3 and LED4 are ON. 

Communication error are handled in master an slave sides, their occurrence will 
be signaled by puting LED3 and LED4 On.
  

The File "I2C/I2C_TwoBoards/DataExchangeInterrupt/main.h" allows different 
possibilities of configuration of this example:
  - Addressing mode : 7-bit or 10-bit
  - I2C speed: Fast mode or Standard mode

In both boards, the data transfers is managed using I2Cx_EV_IRQHandler 
and I2Cx_ER_IRQHandler in stm32l1xx_it.c file.

The SysTick is configured to generate interrupt each 10ms. A dedicated counter 
inside the SysTick ISR is used to toggle the LD1 each 100ms indicating that the 
firmware is running.

A defined communication timeout is insuring that the application will not remain 
stuck if the I2C Master communication is corrupted.
You can adjust this timeout through the USER_TIMEOUT  define inside main.h file
depending on CPU frequency and application conditions (interrupts routines, 
number of data to transfer, speed, CPU frequency...).

@par Hardware and Software environment
  
  - This example runs on STM32L1xx Ultra Low Power High-, Medium-Density and Medium-Density Plus Devices.

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32L152D-EVAL (STM32L1xx 
    Ultra Low Power High-Density) and STM32L152-EVAL (STM32L1xx Ultra Low 
    Power Medium-Density) evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any 
    other supported device and development board.

  - STM32L152-EVAL Set-up

    - Connect I2C1 Master SCL pin (PB.06) to I2C1 Slave SCL (PB.06)
    - Connect I2C1 Master SDA pin (PB.07) to I2C1 Slave SDA (PB.07)
    
  - STM32L152D-EVAL Set-up

    - Connect I2C1 Master SCL pin (PB.08) to I2C1 Slave SCL (PB.08)
    - Connect I2C1 Master SDA pin (PB.09) to I2C1 Slave SDA (PB.09)

   @note  
    - Pull-up resistors should be connected to I2C SCL and SDA Pins in case of 
      other boards use.
      Pull-up  resistors are already implemented on the STM32L152-EVAL evaluation 
      boards.
