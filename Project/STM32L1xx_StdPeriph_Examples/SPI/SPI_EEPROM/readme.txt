@par Example Description 

This firmware provides a basic example of how to use the SPI firmware library and
an associate SPI EEPROM driver to communicate with an I2C EEPROM device (here the
example is interfacing with M95xxx EEPROM)

SPI peripheral is configured in Master during write and read operations from SPI 
EEPROM. 

The peripheral used is SPI1 but can be configured by modifying the defines values
in stm32l152d_eval.h file. The speed is set to 16MHz.

First, the content of Tx1_Buffer is written to the EEPROM_WriteAddress1 and the
written data are read. The written and the read buffers data are then compared.
Following the read operation, the program waits that the EEPROM reverts to its 
Standby state. A second write operation is, then, performed and this time, Tx2_Buffer
is written to EEPROM_WriteAddress2, which represents the address just after the last 
written one in the first write. After completion of the second write operation, the 
written data are read. The contents of the written and the read buffers are compared.

This example provides the possibility to use the STM32L152D-EVAL LCD screen for
messages display (transfer status: Ongoing, PASSED, FAILED).
To enable this option uncomment the define ENABLE_LCD_MSG_DISPLAY in the main.c
file.

@par Hardware and Software environment
  
  - This example runs on STM32L1xx Ultra Low Power High-, Medium-Density and Medium-Density Plus Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested STM32L152D-EVAL board RevA with the on board
    hardware (SPI M95xxx EEPROM) and can be easily tailored to any other 
    development board.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32L1xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example

@note
- Ultra Low Power Medium-density devices are STM32L151xx and STM32L152xx 
  microcontrollers where the Flash memory density ranges between 64 and 128 Kbytes.
- Ultra Low Power Medium-density Plus devices are STM32L151xx, STM32L152xx and 
  STM32L162xx microcontrollers where the Flash memory density is 256 Kbytes.
- Ultra Low Power High-density devices are STM32L151xx, STM32L152xx and STM32L162xx 
  microcontrollers where the Flash memory density is 384 Kbytes.
