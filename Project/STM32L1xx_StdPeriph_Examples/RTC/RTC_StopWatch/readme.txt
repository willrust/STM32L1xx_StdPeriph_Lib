@par Example Description 

  This example illustrates how to use the STM32L1xx new RTC's sub-seconds and
  Tamper feature (Filter, sampling) features. It simulates a precise chronometer
  with 5 record times possibilities stored in the Backup registers (5 registers
  for time (second, minutes and hours) and 5 registers for subsecond).
  
  For this example an interactive human interface is developed using
  STM32L152D_EVAL’s LCD and Push Buttons to allow user to use StopWatch with real 
  time display.

  After startup, a default 00:00:00:000 chronometer counter is displayed on the 
  LCD, it correspond to [Hours]:[minutes]:[seconds]:[milliseconds].
  User can manipulate the chronometer features using Joystick LEFT, RIGHT and Key buttons:
    - press Joystick LEFT  button to start counter.
    - press Joystick RIGHT button to save trials in the backup registers (max 5 actions).
    - press and hold Key button for 1 sec to reset all the backup registers.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32L1xx Ultra Low Power High-Density and Medium-Density Plus Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32L152D-EVAL (STM32L1xx 
    Ultra Low Power High-Density) evaluation board and can be easily tailored 
    to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32L152D-EVAL Set-up
    - Use Key push button.
    - Use Joystick LEFT  button. 
    - Use Joystick RIGHT button.

       
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32L1xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example

@note
- Ultra Low Power Medium-density devices are STM32L151xx and STM32L152xx 
  microcontrollers where the Flash memory density ranges between 64 and 128 Kbytes.
- Ultra Low Power Medium-density Plus devices are STM32L151xx, STM32L152xx and 
  STM32L162xx microcontrollers where the Flash memory density is 256 Kbytes.
- Ultra Low Power High-density devices are STM32L151xx, STM32L152xx and STM32L162xx 
  microcontrollers where the Flash memory density is 384 Kbytes.
