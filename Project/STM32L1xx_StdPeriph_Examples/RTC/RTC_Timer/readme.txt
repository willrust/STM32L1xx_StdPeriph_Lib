@par Example Description 

  This example provides a short description of how to use the RTC peripheral’s with 
  Alarm sub seconds feature to simulate a timer with refresh time equal to 250 ms
  (1 second/ 8) * 2).
  The RTC is configured to generate sub seconds interrupt each 125ms (will have
  8 interrupt per 1 second).
  
  For this example an interactive human interface is developed using
  STM32L152D_EVAL’s LCD and Push Buttons to allow user to use Timer with a real "sand timer"
  display.

  After startup, the sand timer is equal to 1 Minute (60 Seconds) and by pressing on
  the RIGHT button the bottom bulb start to be filled for each 2 successive
  interrupts (after each 250ms).
  After 480 interrupts (60 * 8) the bottom bulb will be full.

  User can manipulate the chronometer features using the Joystick LEFT, RIGHT, UP and DOWN buttons:
    - press Joystick RIGHT button to Start the timer.
    - press again Joystick RIGHT button to stop the timer.
    - press Joystick LEFT button to Restart the timer.
    - press Joystick  UP/DWON button to adjust the timer.

@note The "system_stm32l1xx.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration 
      system and can be easily customized to your own configuration. 
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32L1xx_Clock_Configuration_V1.1.0.xls" 
      provided with the AN3309 package available on <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/family/141.jsp">  ST Microcontrollers </a>
         
      
@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32L1xx Ultra Low Power High-Density and Medium-Density Plus Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32L152D-EVAL (STM32L1xx 
    Ultra Low Power High-Density) evaluation board and can be easily tailored 
    to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32L152D-EVAL Set-up
    - Use Joystick LEFT button. 
    - Use Joystick RIGHT button.
    - Use Joystick UP button. 
    - Use Joystick DOWN button.

       
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32L1xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example

@note
- Ultra Low Power Medium-density devices are STM32L151xx and STM32L152xx 
  microcontrollers where the Flash memory density ranges between 64 and 128 Kbytes.
- Ultra Low Power Medium-density Plus devices are STM32L151xx, STM32L152xx and 
  STM32L162xx microcontrollers where the Flash memory density is 256 Kbytes.
- Ultra Low Power High-density devices are STM32L151xx, STM32L152xx and STM32L162xx 
  microcontrollers where the Flash memory density is 384 Kbytes.
