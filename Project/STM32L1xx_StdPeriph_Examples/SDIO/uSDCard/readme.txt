@par Example Description 

This example provides a basic example of how to use the SDIO firmware library and
an associate driver to perform read/write operations on the SD Card memory (SD Card 
V1.0, V1.1, V2.0 and SDHC (High Capacity) protocol)that could be mounted on the 
STM32L152D-EVAL board.
Below is a description of the different example steps:
  - Configure the SDIO according to the desired SDIO_CK clock frequency.
  - Reset the SD Card
  - Identify the SD Card
  - Initializes the SD Card
  - Get the SD Card Info
  - Select the SD Card
  - Enable the Wide Bus mode (4-bit data)
  - Erase the corresponding blocks
  - Read the Erased blocks
  - Test if the corresponding Blocks are well erased: check if the EraseStatus 
    variable is equal to PASSED.
  - Set the Data Transfer Mode to DMA   
  - Write a single Block             
  - Read a single Block
  - Compare the written Block and the read one: check if the TransferStatus1 
    variable is equal to PASSED.
  - Write multiple Blocks (2)             
  - Read multiple Blocks (2)
  - Compare the written Blocks and the read one: check if the TransferStatus2 
    variable is equal to PASSED.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32L1xx Ultra Low Power High-Density Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32L152D-EVAL (STM32L1xx 
    Ultra Low Power High-Density) evaluation board and can be easily tailored 
    to any other supported device and development board.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32L1xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example 

@note
- Ultra Low Power Medium-density devices are STM32L151xx and STM32L152xx 
  microcontrollers where the Flash memory density ranges between 64 and 128 Kbytes.
- Ultra Low Power Medium-density Plus devices are STM32L151xx, STM32L152xx and 
  STM32L162xx microcontrollers where the Flash memory density is 256 Kbytes.
- Ultra Low Power High-density devices are STM32L151xx, STM32L152xx and STM32L162xx 
  microcontrollers where the Flash memory density is 384 Kbytes.
