@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the COMP peripheral to compare the external
voltage applied on PB12 (for STM32L152-EVAL) or PF10 (for STM32L152D-EVAL) with 
the Internal Voltage Reference. And when the comparator 1 non inverting input 
(which is connected to PB12/PF10) crosses (either rising or falling edges) the 
internal reference voltage VREFINT (1.22V), the comparator 1 generates an interrupt 
and toggles LED1.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L1xx Ultra Low Power High-, Medium-Density and Medium-Density Plus Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32L152D-EVAL (STM32L1xx 
    Ultra Low Power High-Density) and STM32L152-EVAL (STM32L1xx Ultra Low 
    Power Medium-Density) evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any 
    other supported device and development board.


  - STM32L152-EVAL Set-up
    - Use LED1 connected respectively to PD.00 pin
    - Use the potentiometer RV3
    - Before Running the example make sure that JP17 is at PB12 position.

  - STM32L152D-EVAL Set-up
    - Use LED1 connected to PD.03 pin
    - Use the potentiometer RV3
    - Before Running the example make sure that JP13 is at ADC position.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32L1xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example

@note
- Ultra Low Power Medium-density devices are STM32L151xx and STM32L152xx 
  microcontrollers where the Flash memory density ranges between 64 and 128 Kbytes.
- Ultra Low Power Medium-density Plus devices are STM32L151xx, STM32L152xx and 
  STM32L162xx microcontrollers where the Flash memory density is 256 Kbytes.
- Ultra Low Power High-density devices are STM32L151xx, STM32L152xx and STM32L162xx 
  microcontrollers where the Flash memory density is 384 Kbytes.
